<!--the <strong> element gives the words “Alex Ferguson” more importance
    the <q> marks his quote about Inzaghi
    <p> is the parent element of <strong> and <q>

  <h1>Famous football quotes</h1>
  <p>
    Sir <strong>Alex Ferguson</strong> once said about Filipo Inzaghi:<q>"That lad must have been born offside"</q>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When criticized by John Carew, <strong>Zlatan Ibrahimovic</strong> replied: <q>"What Carew does with a football, I can do with an orange"</q>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>George Best</strong> said <q>"I spent a lot of money on booze, birds and fast cars. The rest I just squandered."</q> when asked about his lifestyle.

</article>

In this setup:

<article> is the ancestor of every other element
<article> is the parent of the <h1> and the 3 <p>
<h1> and the 3 <p> are siblings
each <p> is the parent of the <strong> and <q> they contain
every <h1>, <p>, <strong> and <q> are all descendants of <article>
The family tree analogy still applies when traversing several layers of HTML nesting:

a descendant of element X is any element contained within X
a child is just a direct descendant
an ancestor of element Y is any element that contains Y
the parent is just the first direct ancestor
a sibling of element X is any element which has the same parent-->
